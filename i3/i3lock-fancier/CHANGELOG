	• Do I really have to keep track of changes in this file?
	• Anyway, since last time, we have (supposedly) added support for
		ini file configuration, 
	• fixed troubles with keyboard layout indicator,
	• and even refactored some code and fixed memory leaks.

	• Replaced longopt with ini config file. Just prototype.
	• Figured out how to place keyboard indicator on screen, however
		it's not working like expected yet.
